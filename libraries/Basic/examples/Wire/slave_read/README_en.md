- This example demonstrates how to use I2C as a slave to read data.
- The routine will periodically read the data sent by the I2C master.

## Hardware configuration:
- According to the pin index information of the development board, the I2C master and I2C slave boards are connected.
- start the I2C slave board first, then start the I2C master board.
