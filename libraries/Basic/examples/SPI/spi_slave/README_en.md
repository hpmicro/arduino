# SPI SLAVE TRANSFER EXAMPLE

- The sample code shows how to use SPI slave to transfer data.

- The samples will send and receive a fixed length data periodically.

## Hardware configuration:
- According to the pin index information of the development board, the SPI master and SPI slave boards are connected.
- Two boards must be connected with GND to ensure the signal transmission.
- start the SPI slave board first, then start the SPI master board.
